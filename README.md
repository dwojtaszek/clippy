# droid-usage

![droid-usage running against sample data](docs/demo.gif)

`droid-usage` prints a usage report for three coding agents, read from their local session logs:

- **Droid**, Factory's CLI (`~/.factory/sessions`)
- **OpenCode** (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`)
- **agy**, the Antigravity CLI (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`)

The report shows totals by source, a weekly trend, cost and tokens per model, and the top projects. The demo above runs `droid-usage --offline` on the anonymized fixtures in `tests/golden/home`.

## Run

```sh
cargo build --release
target/release/droid-usage            # refreshes saved prices if they are over 24 hours old
target/release/droid-usage --offline  # uses the saved prices only, no network
```

Saved price and multiplier snapshots live in `~/.local/share/droid-usage/`. A refresh downloads two public files and nothing else:

- Multipliers: `https://docs.factory.com/models.md`
- List prices: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json`

Nothing is uploaded. The program reads local files, and it makes those two GET requests only during a refresh.

## How cost is estimated

- **Droid** sessions use the list price from the LiteLLM table, times the multiplier on Factory's models page.
- **OpenCode** and **agy** sessions use the cost recorded in the session when there is one. Otherwise they use the LiteLLM price.
- A session with an unknown model counts toward tokens but not cost. The report says how many sessions this affects.

## Development

```sh
cargo test
```
